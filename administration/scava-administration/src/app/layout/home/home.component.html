                    <!-- <p>CROSSMINER aims to extend the state-of-the-art in the field of automated analysis and measurement of open-source software (OSS) by developing a platform that will support decision makers in the process of discovering, comparing, assessing and monitoring the health, quality, impact and activity of open-source software.</p> -->
                    <p>CROSSMINER computes trustworthy quality indicators of open-source software by performing advanced analysis
                        and integration of information from diverse sources including the project metadata, source code repositories,
                        communication channels and bug tracking systems of OSS projects.</p>
                    <p>CROSSMINER is not another OSS forge but instead it provides a meta-platform for analysing existing OSS
                        projects that are developed in existing OSS forges and foundations such as SourceForge, Google Code,
                        GitHub, Eclipse, Mozilla and Apache.</p>
