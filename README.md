# Scava

Software engineers spend most of their time learning to understand the software they maintain or depend on (or will depend on). The goal of this learning process is to support decision-making. In this project, we focus on the increasing dependence on open-source software (OSS) over the last years and the decisions related to depending on open-source software.

Eclipse SCAVA will support the efficient and effective decision-making regarding dependence on OSS projects and components thereof. This entails both decisions at the architecture level (to decide which OSS project to use) and at the code level (to design the use of the OSS project). In particular, SCAVA will provide techniques and tools for extracting knowledge from existing open source components, and use such knowledge to properly select and reuse existing software to develop new systems. The activity of the developer will be continuously monitored in order to raise alerts related to the quality of the selected OSS projects and to give suggestions that can reduce the development effort and increase the quality of the final software products.
