# Dependencies Dashboard

The dependencias dashboard shows a network graph with the dependencies between
items in CROSSMINER projects.

In the current version it shows the dependencies between the bundles of a Java
projects. The data with the dependencies is generated by CWI partner. If you want to test all, just ask for them because they are not public yet.

## Using the Scava Deployment project

Using the project [Scava Deployment Project](https://github.com/crossminer/scava-deployment) the
Dependencies dashboard will be automatically created and deployed.

But until this is implemented, in the next sections the use of the toolchain is described
in order to do manually the creation and deploying of the dependencies dashboard.

## Install

[Elasticsearch and Kibana must be running](/web-dashboards#install-elasticsearch-and-kibana).

And the [GrimoireLab python env must be active](/web-dashboards#install-grimoirelab-python-env)

Now the tool can be executed with:

```
./dependencies2es.py  -f eclipse4.6-draft-corpus/json/requiredBundles.json -e http://bitergia:bitergia@localhost:9200 -i dependencies
2017-11-28 12:43:47,415 Importing items from eclipse4.6-draft-corpus/json/requiredBundles.json to http://bitergia:bitergia@localhost:9200/dependencies
2017-11-28 12:43:47,423 Loading dependencies in Elasticsearch ...
2017-11-28 12:43:47,427 Import all JSON items with dependencies from: eclipse4.6-draft-corpus/json/requiredBundles.json
2017-11-28 12:43:49,807 Import completed.
```

And now the Kibana panel can be imported to show the data:

`kidash.py -e http://bitergia:bitergia@localhost:9200 --import panels/dependencies.json`

The panel is ready at the URL:

http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/dashboard/AV7m5g5kfuk55ZFAddq4
