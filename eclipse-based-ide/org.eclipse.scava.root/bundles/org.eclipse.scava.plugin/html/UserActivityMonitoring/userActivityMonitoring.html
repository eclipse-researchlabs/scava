<h1>User Activity Monitoring</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
    The main components of this scenario is the recording of developer interactions (events), computing process related metrics and sending them to the
    CROSSMINER server for further processing. The collected events is stored
    in a local database. Please note that none of the stored event contains information about the user, so there is no way to identify someone from these
    data, also all of the events are stored in a local database and only the metrics
    are sent to the CROSSMINER Server.
