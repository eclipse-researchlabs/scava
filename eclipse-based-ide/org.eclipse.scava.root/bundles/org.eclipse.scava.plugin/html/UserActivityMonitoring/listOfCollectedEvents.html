<h1>List of Collected Events</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
    <p><strong>Document event</strong> Our plug-in using it to detect all keypresses in the editor
        and store which file is affected. For example during the implementation
        of a new method for an existing class.</p>
    <p><strong>Part event</strong> It stores information about life cycle of given parts (part activating, part
        deactivating, part closing etc). For example when you
        work on a existing class and select something in the Package Explorer.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Window event</strong> It stores information about window life cycle the same way
        as the Part event handles information about parts. For example when
        you open an another program.</p>
    <p><strong>Eclipse close event</strong> Eclipse closes are stored in this even type.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Launch event </strong> It stores information about code building and launching.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Resource element event</strong> It stores information about the file saving and
        deletion.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Class path event</strong> It stores information about class path changing (add
        entry to class path or removed entry from class path). For example
        when you add a library to your clashpath.</p>

    <p><strong>Idle event</strong> When there is no new event in the database for a pre-set amount of time we assume that to indicate the user is not using the IDE.</p>

    <p><strong>Project Structure Builder event</strong> This is a special event that is in charge for mapping the hierarchy of the project. It creates the graph representation of the project in the database. It is called when we open Eclipse or open a project.</p>

    <p><strong>Scheduled upload event</strong> This event schedules the next metric upload.</p>

    <p><strong>Test event</strong> It stores information about testing.</p>

    <p><strong>Search event</strong> It stores information about using Eclipse search function.</p>

    <p><strong>CROSSMINER events</strong> These events are invoked by using plug-in. It
        needs to be calculated for those metrics which measure the plug-in
        usage. For example when you use CROSSMINER Library Search function.</p>
