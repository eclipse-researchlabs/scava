    In the case of unexpected errors during the user activity monitoring, you are
    able to check the value of the process metrics and some relevant meta-data
    about the underlying database on the client side. To do this please activate
    some of the plug-in side debugging features. Please note that these are only
    available in the debug version of the plug-in.
