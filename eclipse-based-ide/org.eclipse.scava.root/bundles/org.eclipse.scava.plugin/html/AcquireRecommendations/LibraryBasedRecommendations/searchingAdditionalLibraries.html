<h1>Searching Additional Libraries</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
    To search for libraries that can be useful during the development of your
    project, open the Library search dialog. For this, first you have to select the
    project in the Package explorer view. This feature works only with Maven
    projects, that contains their pom.xml file in their root folder. Then navigate
    in the menu to the CROSSMINER menu and click on the Search libraries
    option. This will bring up the Library search dialog.
    <br>

    This dialog is split into two parts. On the left side you can see the
    currently used libraries in your project and on the right side there are the
    suggested libraries. Both the left and the right side contains their libraries
    in two separate groups. On the left side, in the upper group there are the
    libraries that has been selected to be used as the base of the search. The
    suggested libraries may vary by the different set of selected libraries. On
    the bottom there are the libraries that has not been selected yet. On the
    right side, in the lower group there are the libraries that the CROSSMINER
    suggested for you to use in your project.

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px">
        <img src="../../images/library-search-results.png" width="100%">
        <p>Library search dialog - results</p>
    </div>

    These libraries can be selected to be installed, and
    if they are, then they move to the upper group which contains the libraries
    that has been selected to be installed.


    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px">
        <img src="../../images/library-search-selected.png" width="100%">
        <p>Library search dialog - selected to install</p>
    </div>

    Every time you change the search parameters, so the set of libraries that
    are used as the base of the search, the suggested libraries will be reloaded. If
    something goes wrong so the libraries cannot be retrieved from the CROSSMINER server, a Try again button will be shown and by clicking that you
    can initiate a new request to load them.

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px">
        <img src="../../images/library-search-try-again.png" width="100%">
        <p>Library search dialog - try again</p>
    </div>

    After selecting the set of libraries that you want to use in your project,
    by clicking on the install button you can add them to your project. They
    will show up among the dependencies in the project's pom.xml.
