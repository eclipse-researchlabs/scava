<h1>Project Search</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
    To search for projects which can be installed into your system, select the
    Project Search feature under the CROSSMINER menu. After the dialog
    opened, you can type the desired search expression into the search field.
    After that, hit enter or click on the Search button. The results are going to
    show up in a new tab in the middle of the dialog. Every search is going to
    open a new tab and show up inside that.

    On the left part of this tab you can see the results list. Initially only
    a few of these results are shown in the list, but by clicking on the Show
    more button at the bottom some more results can be requested. If no more
    results can be loaded then the button will no longer be available. By clicking on these items a couple of
    informations are shown in the right part of the search tab, like a description
    or the dependencies. You can navigate to the GitHub repository, to the
    official website of the project or to the related CROSSMINER Web-based
    Dashboard site. You can initiate a new search for similar projects to the
    given project by clicking on the similarity method buttons. These are the
    Compound, Crossim, Dependency, Crossrec, Readme, RepoPalCompound
    and RepoPalCompoundV2. Or you can select the given project result to be
    installed by clicking on the Add button in the result's box. The selected
    projects are shown on the right side of the dialog in a list. By clicking on
    these items you can view the details of them such like in the previous case.
    You can deselect these items by clicking on the Remove button. After you
    chose the wanted projects to be installed click on the Install button on the
    bottom of the dialog.

    </div>

    In the install dialog you can set the base path to the location where
    you want to install the projects by default. After updating this path all of
    the projects destination location is going to be updated. You can see this
    property of the projects on the bottom of the dialog, in the project list.
    All of the projects can be installed into different locations from the default
    by giving them a custom destination path. After setting all of the desired
    install paths, you can choose to install all the projects at once by clicking
    on the Install all button or you can install them one-by-one manually, by
    clicking on the Install buttons of the projects. The installation process can
    be canceled by clicking on the Cancel buttons.
