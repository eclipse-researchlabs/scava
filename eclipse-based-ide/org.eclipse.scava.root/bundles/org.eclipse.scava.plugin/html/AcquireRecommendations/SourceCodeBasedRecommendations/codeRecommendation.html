<h1>Code recommendation</h1>
<div style="text-align: justify; margin: 30px">
    Code recommendations are used to retrieve code snippets which may be useful for you by showing an example implementation if a specific library or just
    presenting a pattern that can be followed. These snippets can be requested
    by selecting a chunk of code in an open Java source code editor and by
    clicking on the Request code recommendation option in the context menu's
    CROSSMINER submenu or by using the Ctrl+Shift+X C key combination.
    After the Code recommendation view has shown up the suggested patterns
    for this file will be displayed on the left side in a hierarchical representation.
    The results are grouped by the file, they are relevant to and by the query,
    which represents the request for the recommendations at a given time using
    a given part of the file.

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px">
        <img src="../../images/code-recommendation-results.png" width="100%">
        <p> Code recommendation view - suggested patterns</p>
    </div>

    By selecting a pattern in the hierarchical tree view the recommended
    snippet will be shown in the preview view on the right side of the Code
    recommendation view. Here you can examine the given code, copy a part
    of it or by using the Insert snippet at cursor button you can paste it into
    the active editor at the cursor's position or replace the selected code chunk
    with it. This functionality is available only when there is an active editor
    opened.

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px">
        <img src="../../images/code-recommendation-preview.png" width="100%">
        <p> Code recommendation view - preview snippet</p>
    </div>

    You can also remove the recommended code snippets from the results by
    opening the context menu over them and choosing the right option for you.
    Basically there are 4 options that you can go with. If you select a file you
    have the option to drop all the recommendation that are related to that file.
    If you select the recommendation query, you can drop all results for that
    request. If you select the code recommendations you can drop the items one-by-one. Or in all cases there is an option to drop all the recommendations,
    and this will clear the results view.
